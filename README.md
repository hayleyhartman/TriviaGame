# TriviaGame
This game was a project completed in September 2018 in order to demonstrate understanding of basic jQuery and javascript concepts such as jQuery syntax, click events, and timers.
Each time the quiz starts it gives the user 30 seconds to answer 8 questions about the things that were on my desk when the quiz was written. After time runs out or the user clicks the 'finished' button, the quiz tells you your score.
